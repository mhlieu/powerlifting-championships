USAPL Virginia State Championships 2021
This is a collection of dashboards used to visualize stats from the USA Powerlifting Virginia State Championships meet of 2021.
The four tabs depict the following:
  ðŸ’¡ Competitor pool profile, broken out by age, weight classes, equipment used, gender and the states they represented
  ðŸ’¡ Results of the event, on an individual and weight-class-averaged basis, measured in Goodlift Points (which measures an individual's strength, normalized for his/her bodyweight, gender and whether the individual lifted raw or equipped)
  ðŸ’¡ Results of the event again, but measured in DOTS (a different measure commonly used, but only normalizes for his/her bodyweight and gender)
  ðŸ’¡ Individual attempts by all competitors across all 3 lifts, showing which attempts were good lift (e.g. successful attempt) or no lift (e.g. failed attempt)
